## Linear Regression to Predict MPG

The variables that provided a non-random amount of variance to the mpg vlaues were vehicle weight, spoiler angle, and AWD.  The slope of the linear model is not considered to be zero, for the R-squared value is 0.7149.  This linear model does predict mpg of MechaCar prototypes effectively, for the variables in this model provide a good analysis for predicting the mpg of MechaCar prototypes.

## Summary Statistics on Suspension Coils

The design specifications for the MechaCar suspension coils dictate that the variance of the suspension coils must not exceed 100 pounds per square inch.  The current manufacturing data does not meet the design specification.  The total summary's mean is 1498 with a standard deviation of 7.89 and a variance of 62.30.  This means that the PSI is over the design specification.  Lot1's mean is 1500, Lot2's mean is 1500, and Lot3's mean is 1496.  Based on the manufacturing data the MechCars are not up to date with design specification.

## Study Design: MechaCar vs Competition

One way to quantify how the MechaCar performs against the competition would be to perform a statistical analysis on cost, fuel efficiency, maintenance cost, and safety rating.  These metrics seem to be a driving factor in a consumer's decision on which car to purchase.  This study would require a lot of manufacturing and consumer rating data from MechaCar and the competition we are comparing with.  I would then perform a one sample t-test on each of the above listed metrics, for this would provide a good analysis between the car manufacturers.  The hypothesis would be that MechaCar is more likely to out sell other car manufacturers if MechaCar leads each manufacturer in the above listed metrics.
