The variables that provided a non-random amount of variance to the mpg vlaues were vehicle weight, spoiler angle, and AWD.  The slope of the linear model is not considered to be zero, for the R-squared value is 0.7149.  This linear model does predict mpg of MechaCar prototypes effectively, for the variables in this model provide a good analysis for predicting the mpg of MechaCar prototypes.
